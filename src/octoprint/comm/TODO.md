# General TODOs

  * Protocols
    * Firmware detection vs connection sequence, warnings trigger too late/not at all
  * Anything missing from settings migration to profile?
  * Disconnect after incomplete connect/reset states
  * port/usbid/serial vs availability -- we need a combo box for that stuff, not just a drop down
  * Failing tests

TBC
